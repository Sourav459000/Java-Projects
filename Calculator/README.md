# Calculator

A simple graphical calculator application created using Java Swing. This application provides basic arithmetic operations and additional features such as square, square root, and exponentiation.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
- **Advanced Operations**:
  - Square (x²)
  - Square Root (√x)
  - Exponentiation (x^y)
- **User Interface**: A clean and user-friendly interface with buttons for each operation and a text field for displaying results.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
